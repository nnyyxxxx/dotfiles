## Disclaimer
These are my personal dotfiles, I recommend not using them unless you want to tinker with it for a while. I have monitor configuration set up in hypr/hyprland.conf, that will need to be removed or changed depending on your setup. Of course theming and other stuff will **not** work out of the box, you may be missing things; the install script only gets you about 90% there.

## Usage
Install via curl
  ```shell
  curl -fsSL https://github.com/nnyyxxxx/hyprland/raw/main/install.sh | sh
  ```
